If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. uhhhhhhh Everything I know to be true just went out the window. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it.</p>

          <h3>Nothin’ like bamboo</h3>
          <p>Special cloth alert. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. We the best. They don’t want us to win. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up.</p>
